# ESPCompanionApp
This page describes various aspects of the Android based ESPCompanion app.

## Overview

When a new ESP device is booted for the first time, it contains some default credentials for its hotspot configuration. This makes the device 
vulnarable to the attackers who could guess the credentials and essentially control the device for their own use. The android app act as a 
means to securely configure the ESP8266 device when it is booted for the first and subsequent times. The app is fairly easy to install 
and use with the device. As a prototype implementation it can only send local network (home wifi) credentials and a user token, however,
it could be extended to support more features, such as, dual authentication, hotspot reconfiguration, token management, etc.
