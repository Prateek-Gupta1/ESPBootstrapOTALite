# ESPSensorManagementSystem
A sensor management solution that allows developers to get started with ESP8266 devices for personal and professional use.

## Get started with an end-to-end IoT solution for Arduino based wifi enabled microcontrollers
Firmware engineers and IoT enthusiasts often find it difficult to develop an infrastructure to manage their IoT devices and the data flow 
in the network. This project is an effort to provide an extensible and secure backend infrastructure that could help individuals and 
corporations to setup a sensor management system with minimum efforts. This project is a prototype implementation developed to manage 
ESP8266 wifi micro-chip, however, the server and the mobile app could be tailored to handle any Wifi enabled micro controller and sensors.

## Overview
The entire solution is divided into two distinguished projects.
- **Project A:** An *ESP8266 Sensor Management library* and the corresponding *Web server* to configure and manage ESP devices and the sensors attached on them.
- **Project B:** It consists of an *Android companion app*, a *ESP bootstrap library* and an *Application server* to manage OTA firmware updates of ESPs.
